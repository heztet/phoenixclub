# Welcome to Phoenix Club!
Since the Phoneix Club's website was last updated in 2006, I've decided that I'm going to re-work it for HTML5. Basically, I want to make it look aesthetically pleasing and have ways for people to get in contact with our club.

# To Do
- [X] Implement HTML5 UP!'s ~Fractal~ Helios Template
- [X] Populate template with Phoenix Club's info
- [ ] Track GA attendance with a ~~Rails~~ Codeigniter app
	- [ ] `set_value` in all forms with validation
	- [ ] Individual `form_error` for each form field
	- [ ] Bootstrap
		- [ ] Header/footer
		- [ ] Forms
		- [ ] Table views of students and events
	- [ ] Users & admin pages
- [ ] Push to server!

# Why Codeigniter?
Originally I was going to build a Rails app, but Purdue's web servers only support mysql and PHP. I chose Codeigniter because it was the simplest PHP framework to use; I only had to download it and put it in the proper folder.
