# Welcome to Phoenix Club!
This is the repo for the Purdue Hillenbrand Hall Phoenix Club website, which holds the club's attendance records, event data, documents (bills, meeting minutes, etc.), floor point amounts, and important links.

This website uses the [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/) PHP framework, in part because Purdue University servers only allow PHP web services and because CodeIgniter is easy to implement and install.

# To Do for v2.4
- [X] Add URL shortener
- [X] Add delete ability
- [X] Add functionality to 'Copy' button for URL shortener
- [X] Have `/pages` check for shortened link
- [X] Update dash with URL shortener
- [X] Delete links on reset year
- [ ] Rename `shortener` to `links`
- [ ] Quick point-adder (or link to point-adder) on `/students` if logged in
- [ ] Quick point adder uses `phoenix_records`
- [ ] Ability to edit student (everything but PUID)
- [ ] Ability to edit events

# Branch descriptions
- The `develop` branch is where changes are staged for production
- The `production` branch is what the Phoenix Club server is currently running (through Purdue University's servers)

# Help! How do I put this in production mode?
- In `application/config/config.php`, set `$config['log_threshold'] = 1;`
- In `application/config/config.php`, set `$config['base_url'] = '<WEBSITE_URL>';`
- In `application/config/database.php`, set each of the database variables that are set as blank
- In `index.php`, change `define('ENVIRONMENT', isset($_SERVER['CI_ENV']) ? $_SERVER['CI_ENV'] : 'development');` to `define('ENVIRONMENT', 'production');`
- Run `dbSetup.sql` (you can also remove the `AUTO_INCREMENT=<num>` as well)
- Change the values for `BanquetAmount` and `RollcallAmount` in `phoenix_globals`
- Change the username/password in `phoenix_users`
