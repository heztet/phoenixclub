# Help! How do I put this in production mode?
- In `application/config/config.php`, set `$config['log_threshold'] = 1;`
- In `application/config/config.php`, set `$config['base_url'] = '<WEBSITE_URL>';`
- In `application/config/database.php`, set each of the database variables that are set as blank
- In `index.php`, change `define('ENVIRONMENT', isset($_SERVER['CI_ENV']) ? $_SERVER['CI_ENV'] : 'development');` to `define('ENVIRONMENT', 'production');`
- Rum `dbSetup.sql` (you can also remove the `AUTO_INCREMENT=<num>` as well)
- Add a value for `BanquetAmount` in `phoenix_globals`
