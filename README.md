# Welcome to Phoenix Club!
Since the Phoneix Club's website was last updated in 2006, I've decided that I'm going to re-work it for HTML5. Basically, I want to make it look aesthetically pleasing and have ways for people to get in contact with our club.

# To Do
- [ ] Implement HTML5 UP!'s Fractal Template
- [ ] Populate template with Phoenix Club's info
- [ ] Track GA attendance with a Rails app
- [ ] Push to server!
